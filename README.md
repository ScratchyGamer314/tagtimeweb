# TagTime Web
It's like [TagTime](https://tagti.me), but on the web. It has (will have) a number of features:
- works offline once you are logged in
- can be added to the homescreen
- native notifications when it's time to tag your time
- TagTime import/export

## Usage
You can use my [public instance](https://ttw.smitop.com/) or [host it yourself](docs/run-server.md).

## Notes
- It is is internally called `retag`.
