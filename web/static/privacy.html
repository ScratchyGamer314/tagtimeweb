<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. We have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
<h3 id="who-we-are-and-what-this-policy-covers">Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>We are 2708066 Ontario Inc. This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our websites (including <a href="http://ttw.smitop.com">ttw.smitop.com</a>);</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
<h4 id="information-you-provide-to-us"><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. You may provide us with more information but we don’t require that information to create a account.</li>
<li><strong>Payment and contact information:</strong> If you buy something from us, we’ll collect information to process those payments and contact you. If you buy something from us, you’ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you’ve made.</li>
<li><strong>Content information:</strong> You might provide us with information about you in tags.</li>
<li><strong>Communications with us (hi there!):</strong> You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, email us, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-automatically"><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you create or make changes to your website on <a href="http://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services. We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>
<li><strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
<li><strong>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. We may use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources"><em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em></h4>
<p>We may also get information about you from other sources. The information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-we-use-information">How and Why We Use Information</h3>
<h4 id="purposes-for-using-information"><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>
<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>
<li><strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analysing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.</li>
<li><strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>
<li><strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of us and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>
<li><strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
<li><strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services.</li>
<li><strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on ourselves; texting you to verify your payment. If you don’t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we’ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sharing-information">Sharing Information</h3>
<h4 id="how-we-share-information"><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>
<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy. These are spelled out below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyse fraudulent payment transactions, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you); those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams). We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
<li><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of us, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
<li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the event that we goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorise us to do so, like when use a third-party integration.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customised ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell our users’ data. We aren’t a data broker, we don’t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don’t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>
<p>We do not share your tags with third parties.</p>
<h4 id="information-shared-publicly"><em>Information Shared Publicly</em></h4>
<p>Information that you choose to make public is — you guessed it — disclosed publicly. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-we-keep-information">How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information — and we’re not legally required to keep it. We logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyse traffic to our websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorised access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>
<h3 id="choices">Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services — for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge — may not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Close your account:</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services. You may email <a href="mailto:ttw@smitop.com">ttw@smitop.com</a> to request account closure. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above — for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:ttw@smitop.com">ttw@smitop.com</a></p>

<h4 id="third-party-integrations"><em>Third-Party Integrations</em></h4>
<p>If you’d like to use third-party integrations, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties.

We don’t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.</p>
